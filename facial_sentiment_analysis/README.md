  <i>Now everybody around me knows what a sentiment analysis is üòÑÔ∏è</i>
</p>
My intention here is not to present you one of those shiny tutorials but an organic & imperfect journey that I had with unsuccessful Keras models, wrongly tagged stock photos & treacherous Scrapy codes! We have three parts here in total. Let me summarise them for the tl;dr crowd:<br>

* **Part 1:** With just 180 images per class, we are going to create a baseline model with (and without) Image Data Generator module and see the outcome.<br>
* **Part 2:** We are going to loot‚Ä¶ \*cough\* I mean, collect thousands of images with Scrapy and discuss why Pikachu seems impeccably happy all the time!<br>
* **Part 3:** Unveil some of the toolkit to fine-tune our models and prepare the platform to use our pretrained model file and implement it to our webcam.<br>
