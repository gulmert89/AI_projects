# How can City Residents help Revitalize Soil for Organic Food?
>TL;DR: A deep learning model with a QR code output. Visit the [ipynb file](https://github.com/gulmert89/projects/blob/main/hackathon_for_good_india/cityforfood.ipynb) that I wrote.

Let's read the introduction of our [team's article](https://medium.com/indo-data-week/how-can-city-residents-help-revitalize-soil-for-organic-food-ba81c7622586) first and I'll continue afterwards:<br>
_"This prototype has been developed by the **Team - “City for Food”** for **[Hackathon for Good](https://www.indodataweek.com/hackathonforgood)** as part of the **[Indo Data Week 2020](https://www.indodataweek.com/)**,
a co-creation sprint organized by the **DAV Data Solutions** in partnership with **World Startup** and the **Government of Telangana**."_<br>

And me: _"India has a special place in my life: It's the first foreign country that I've traveled to. Now, Indo Data Week's "Hackathon for Good" also became the first hackathon that I ran :) Our team came up with an all-in-one app idea, a prototype that connects farmers, consumers (and so on and on with multiple hashtags and cool terms)..."_<br>

What an adorable comment, right? :grin: _"If it's your [first post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gulmert89_how-can-city-residents-help-revitalize-soil-activity-6741646729222918144-jqP1) in LinkedIn..."_ I said to myself, _"...you have to be kinda cute."_<br>Okay, let me cut to the chase: **What did I accomplish in this project? What did I learn?**<br>
* I tailored a deep learning model and created a QR code that contained the predicted soil temperature and various weather forecast information. Why? I explained it in [our article](https://medium.com/indo-data-week/how-can-city-residents-help-revitalize-soil-for-organic-food-ba81c7622586).
* First time I used an API of a company. There were some bugs and typos in their codes so I had to rack my brain on getting the tiniest bit of data out of it but eventually, learned a lot!
* QR code module is quite simple and powerful. It would be useful in many situations later.
* ...and the most precious gain: I have never been in an international team before, never discussed about a problem/solution in an hackathon. Even though I had to write all of the code by myself till sunshine and never had a technical feedback later on, it was still an interesting journey to deal with lots of ideas, narrow them down to a useful outcome and to be chased by the deadline.
