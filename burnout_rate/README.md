### "I could have done better."
This was the first "active" hackathon that I attended individually. Managed to enter the first 10%, which is a _good-enough_ success for me, but I could have been in the first 50. 
Just the day after the deadline, I came up with an idea _(linearization of a feature which exhibits a polynomial behaviour)_ that pulled me up 10 more people _(48th place)_.<br>
In this notebook ([burning_out.ipynb](https://github.com/gulmert89/projects/blob/main/burnout_rate/burning_out.ipynb)), I wanted to practice the basics of linear regression models and some other ML tools once again since I mostly focused on deep learning lately. Also I posted it as a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/gulmert89/a-regression-adventure-up-to-92-98) (why don't you vote it up, please? :smile:) .<br> I really, REALLY wonder with which solution the person in the first place came up, so I... _\*cough\*_ ...emailed and asked him! _\*stalker alert\*_ He sent me his GitHub link and [ktrain](https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain) was the module he used. I also took a look at [his](https://github.com/victorkras2008/HackerEarth-Machine-Learning-Challenge) solution and saw that he started the model with a different learning rate and a different metric. I think at this point, I might give my code another shot (specifically to the deep learning section) or not. It would be a wiser idea to move forward.<br>
